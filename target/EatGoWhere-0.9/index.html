        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>
          I am a 22 year-old Malaysian currently pursuing my undergraduate at
          Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I have a loving family
          which consists of my sister, both my parents and myself. My parents
          were in the education field, with my father being a lecturer at the
          University of Malaya back in Kuala Lumpur and my mother being a Maths
          teacher in one of the government schools. With that, my sister started
          off her career as a primary school teacher, then proceeded to further
          her studies with a Masters in Education at the National Institute
          Education, Singapore. Now, she's currently a college teacher. I wanted
          to be different, I didn't want to be an educator, I wanted to solve
          problems and help our society grow. So I chose engineering as my
          career path, computer engineering to be exact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Growing up, I didn't have the academic stress that most of my friends
          were experiencing. With my family being in the education field, they
          understood that although education serves as an important base, grades
          are an entire separate matter that did not serve well as a measure of
          how educated a student really is. With that, I did not have to spend
          most of my free time being in tuition like most of my friends. I had
          free time after class and that made it important to my own personal
          growth. After class, I'd usually watch TV or use the computer to play
          my favourite games. My family enjoys watching documentaries, so that's
          what I grew up watching, 'How It's Made' or other animal shows on
          'Animal Planet'. I am a fan of games, I am also one that likes
          precision, which would link up all my hobbies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My gaming history includes famous shooter games including 'Battlefield
          3' and 'Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)', but the first game
          that started this passion was a game that my sister played when I was
          very young, 'Gunbound'. I also enjoyed games that made you grind for
          items, the act of doing something repeatedly for the luck of getting
          something good or the slow process of earning something valueable
          somehow made me really enjoy it. Which I still find weird. I do still
          game, occasionally. I still play CS:GO, PUBG and Rocket League when I
          have the chance to. However, I'm usually down to playing any type of
          games with the condition that I'm playing with friends. (except DotA
          2)
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, my main hobby is playing snooker. When I was first
          introduced to snooker, snooker was like a hardcore version of pool to
          me. I started pool right after I graduated from my secondary school,
          there was a pool club nearby my house that me and my buddies would go
          to every few days(nights). But soon after, I quickly mastered the game
          of pool (or so I thought), the dopamine boost ('syiok' feeling) of
          scoring pool balls and winning soon vanished. So, with the objective
          of getting more of that 'syiokness', I started to try out snooker. But
          my friends didn't really enjoy it, so we sticked to pool. Then when I
          started out in university, there was a snooker competition that was
          held across the halls in my universities. I represented my hall and
          managed to get into the school team. Then I started to appreciate more
          on how skill snooker and pool players are. Remember when I said I
          thought I mastered pool? I was nowhere close.

              An Arduino based robot built to compete in a school-wide
              competition. The robot's role is to map out the 20x15 maze
              environment, find all hidden flags, get the fastest path from the
              starting zone to the finish zone. It was a really time-consuming
              project, but it was pretty fun. Written in C.

            <p>
              We had a free evening, so we decided to hike the nearest mountain
              with no nearby parking. This was shot after our short hike. We
              tried really hard to find out where we parked our car!

            <p>
              While travelling in Prague, we visited the Charles Bridge. It had
              many statues, this stood out after cropping because of the bright
              golden cross and crown.

              Isn't the Google Pixel amazing? This was shot on a Google Pixel 4
              on a starry night in the Saharas. Using it's night mode, it was
              able to capture the stars and the desert, even my eyes couldn't
              see the desert!

            <p>
              Saw this hole in the wall and I took this picture, it was an
              interesting village where access to water is limited. But now the
              main source of income for the villagers is tourism.
